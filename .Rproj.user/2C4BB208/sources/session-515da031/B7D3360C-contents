# Howdy

Hi there - welcome to the new version of my github pages. I've decided I want to work more fully on open source approaches to websites. 


Please expect a great deal of mess while this is starting up.



<ul>
  {% for post in site.posts %}
    <li>
      <a href="{{ post.url }}">{{ post.title }}</a>
    </li>
  {% endfor %}
</ul>
