Jilly MacKay is a Senior Lecturer in Veterinary Science Education at the Royal (Dick) School of Veterinary Studies. She is mainly interested in research methodology an applies this to the field of STEMM education and, occasionally, human-animal-interactions. Jill is interested in the process of science and how we attempt to quantify big, unmeasurable things like 'personality', 'learning' and 'satisfaction'. She is passionate about open science, open educational resources, and public engagement with science. When she's not working, she's probably crafting.
