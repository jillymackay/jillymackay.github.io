abstract: The University of Edinburgh has equipped over 400 teaching spaces with a centrally provided lecture recording service. Jill MacKay used mixed methodologies to explore how staff and student experiences were affected, including National Student Survey, Course Evaluation Questionnaires, and service data. This webinar explored how the University engaged with all available evidence regarding student experience, and shared how they have been developing teaching practice in response.
