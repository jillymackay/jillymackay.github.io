subtitle: 'The value of using open science approaches in operational data'
summary: 'Education institutions collect operational data at a phenomenal rate. While researchers are becoming more and more concerned by ensuring we take a responsible, ethical and repeatable approach to data analysis for research, often the same cannot be said for operational data. At R(D)SVS we have instituted a QA Data Officer role to support educators to make the best use of teaching data'
