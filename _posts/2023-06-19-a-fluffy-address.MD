# Hey

Hey. It's been a while. I have to be honest, I spent a lot of time considering whether I wanted to renew the Fluffy Sciences domain this year. Life is different now. Call it a pandemic. Call it parenthood. Call it millenial burnout. I'm not sure I'm the same person who started the old [FluffySciences Blog](https://fluffysciences.wordpress.com/) but then again, who is?

[Twitter](https://twitter.com/jilly_mackay) certainly isn't. I miss old Twitter. I like [mastodon](https://mastodon.scot/@jillymackay), but I'm not using it properly. Reddit is collapsing. Maybe these systems collapsing is why blogging should continue. 

Nowadays I spent more time thinking about methodology and data, and its this that I think Fluffy Sciences should focus on. So to that end, I'm moving over to a github based system.

So pardon my dust. Maybe things are changing.
